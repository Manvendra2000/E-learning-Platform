A suffix tree **T** for a m-character string S is a rooted directed tree with exactly m leaves numbered 1 to **m.** (Given that last string character is unique in string)

- Root can have zero, one or more children.
- Each internal node, other than the root, has at least two children.
- Each edge is labelled with a nonempty substring of S.
- No two edges coming out of same node can have edge-labels beginning with the same character.

Concatenation of the edge-labels on the path from the root to leaf i gives the suffix of S that starts at position i, i.e. S[iâ€¦m].

- we have two kinds of edges 
  - leaf edge : end with the suffix start
  - non-leaf edges: end with internal node
